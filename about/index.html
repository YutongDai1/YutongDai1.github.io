                <h2>Future Software Engineer</h2>
                <p>Hi there! I'm Alex, an aspiring software engineer with a passion for creating innovative solutions
                    that make a difference. Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, I'm on a journey to explore
                    the vast world of technology and harness its power to solve real-world problems. From developing
                    small utility programs to contributing to open-source projects, every line of code I write brings me
                    closer to understanding the impact of technology on our lives. My academic projects and internships
                    have introduced me to a variety of programming languages and frameworks, with a particular interest
                    in Python, Java, and web development. I believe in continuous learning and am always on the lookout
                    for new challenges that push the boundaries of my knowledge and skills.</p>
                <div class="hobbies-interests">
                    <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
                    <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me immersed in a variety of activities that fuel my creativity
                        and curiosity. I'm an avid reader, with a soft spot for science fiction and fantasy novels.
                        Exploring the outdoors through hiking and cycling allows me to disconnect and find inspiration
                        in nature's beauty. Music plays a big role in my life, whether I'm playing my guitar or
                        discovering new artists and genres. These hobbies not only provide a refreshing break from
                        technology but also enrich my perspective and approach to problem-solving.</p>
